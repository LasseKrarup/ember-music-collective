CESIE is an upcoming danish/british singer-songwriter, dedicated to writing
melodic tales with direct references to her own personal life. Her clarified
voice and the lyrical themes explore an honest and raw perspective on simple
existence.

As a child CESIE grew up in Birmingham (UK) absorbing the
british music scene and she adapted the local essence of being Brit. Letting
poetry reflect in her repetoire of melodies, she has found her own significant
sound and expression, to be witnessed at first hand.

Together with the band she secures a sonic performance triggering the 60â€™s
bright guitar sound, grunge vulnerability and resembles more recent artists
such as Mazzy Star, Feist and PJ Harvey.

In 2018 CESIE received a Talent Grant from Mads Langer, in collaboration with
Engelsholm Castle, to support her music career. Mads Langer quoted "CESIE has
a direct connection to my emotional register. I hope she can touch you too."
