## A road trip with broken brakes

A concert with In Caravans is like a 200 MPH road trip through the desert in a truck without brakes, passing through eerie and mysterious sceneries. Atmospheric, yet straight to the point, In Caravans alternates between fleeting emotion and no-nonsense indie rock.

## Love, solitude and anxiety

Love, addiction, loneliness, stress and friendship - those are the themes of In Caravans' music. Though at times mysterious and hard to decipher, the lyrics often describe the hardest emotions like jealousy and insecurity with a unique clarity.
