Composer and producer Nikoline Ursin Erichsen, alias dragongirl, works at the intersection of club music, contemporary music and performance art. dragongirl composes from the idea of music as a speculative medium, and draws inspiration from literary fantasy, horror movies and video games all the while having a strong idealism as a base. 

dragongirl’s dark musical expeditions is an all-consuming experience, by some described as «almost danceable club music». With suggestive and atmospheric notes, she hints to a future where dragons and machines live together in beautiful harmony.
